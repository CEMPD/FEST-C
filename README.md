# FEST-C
Fertilizer Emission Scenario Tool for CMAQ : Generate fertilizer application input for CMAQ bi-directional NH3 modeling

FEST-C is a Java-based interface system that is used to simulate daily fertilizer application information using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model (http://epicapex.tamu.edu/ epic/) and to extract the EPIC daily output that is a required input for bidirectional NH3 modeling performed using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system (http://www.cmascenter.org/cmaq/). 

The FEST-C Git repository is available for release beginning with FEST-C version 1.2. 

Releases are also available for:
FEST-C version 1.3
FEST-C version 2.0
