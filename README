1. Version 1.3 Updates: 06/30/2017

        1) Added additional output for bare land fraction and soil moisture

        2) General bug fixes for elevation error and parameter inconsistencies 

        3) Adjusted crop input parameters to improve yield evaluation in comparison to observations. 

        4) Added new feature which transfers beld4 file to ioapi format in the beld4 generation utilities.

        5) Added 2011 crop fraction for US and Canada for beld4 generation.

        6) Added NLCD default year when new scenario is created.   
        
        7) Fixed consistent checking on acreage filter and fertlizer year; update on scenario saving structures. 

        8) Update jar packages/utilities to work with 64-bit system.
      
        9) Modified festc run script.  The script name changed from "festc" to "festc.sh"

        10) Enhanced scenario saving feature when exiting festc.

        11) Reduced number of output variables from EPIC2CMAQ

        12) Fixed a bug in the daily extraction for EPIC2CMAQ

2. Installation:

   1) untar FESTC 1.3 package under a working directory by:
      tar -xzvf festc1_3_06302017.tar.gz  

   2) Update FESTC_HOME in file "festc1_3/festc/festc.sh" to have correct directory path for your system
      
   3) Install Spatial Allocator 4.3.1 

   4) Update {SA_HOME}/bin/sa_setup.csh

   5) Update FESTC_HOME and SA_HOME in festc1_3/festc_setup.csh

   6) Source festc1_3/festc_setup.csh file in users' .cshrc file

   7) Update festc1_3/config.properties based on the system and installtion directories

   8) Make a directory "festc" under user's home
  
   9) Copy festc1_3/config.properties to {user's home}/festc directory
 
   10) Type festc to launch the system from any directory


3. Troubleshooting for Spatial Allocator

   The SA Raster Tools have compiled tools which are stored under ${SA_HOME}/bin/64bits.  
   Those executable files may not work depending on the system configuration.  
   If there is a library error in running the SA Raster Tools within FEST-C, users should:

	1) Recompile all libraries under ${SA_HOME}/src/libs following instructions in the ${SA_HOME}/src/libs/README file.

	2) Modiy ${SA_HOME}/src/raster/Makefile for correct paths.

        3) Type "make clean" to clean previous compiled programs.

	4) Type "make" to compile the tools.

	5) Type "make -B install" or "make install" to install compiled tools.
